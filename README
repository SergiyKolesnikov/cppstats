cppstats is a suite of analyses for measuring cpp-preprocessor based variability
in software product lines

HOW TO
---------------------------------
supply cppstats with the appropriate paths in cppstats_input.txt
	- use full paths like "/local/repos/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2"
	- each project folder given in the file has to be structured as follows:
		- mpsolve-2.2/ 
			- source/ (here are the C source files)

Then run:
$ ./cppstats.py --kind <K> 
Have a look on "./cppstats.py --help" for further command line options.

The output files for each analysis are written to the folders given in cppstats_input.txt.
