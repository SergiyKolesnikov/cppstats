cppstats INSTALLATION OVERVIEW


Overview
--------

cppstats should be runnable under following systems:
- Linux/Ubuntu,
- Mac OS X, and
- Cygwin.

In detail, cppstats was successfully tested under:
- Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit, Python 2.7.3,
- Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, Python 2.7.6, and
- Cygwin 64-bit, Python 2.7.3.

Right now Python 3.x is NOT supported.

Current shipped version of srcML within lib/srcml/:
Trunk 19109c Thu May 22 09:18:31 2014 -0400
- linux/:   Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit
- darwin/:  OS X Mavericks
- win/: Windows


xUBUNTU
-------------

1. install git

   $ sudo apt-get install git

1.1 checkout repo

    - NOTE: The old branch 'cygwin' is discontinued after version 0.8.
    $ git clone https://github.com/clhunsen/cppstats.git

2. install needed libraries (+ all dependencies)

    $ sudo apt-get install astyle  # artistic style (code formatter)
    $ sudo apt-get install xsltproc  # XSLT 1.0 command line processor
    $ sudo apt-get install libxml2 libxml2-dev  # library for processing XML
    $ sudo apt-get install python python-libxml2 python-lxml python-notify python-lxml  # Python and needed libraries
    $ sudo apt-get install gcc  # GNU compiler collection

2.1 download srcML libraries (current shipped version of srcML is supplied above!)
    - download a binary package that is sufficient for you from: http://www.srcml.org/lmcrs
    - extract into subfolder lib/srcml/linux/, so that binaries are available there directly
        > like "lib/srcml/linux/srcml2src"

2.2 if using 32-bit srcML libraries on an 64-bit platform

    $ sudo apt-get install ia32-libs  # 32bit compatibility libs (only on 64bit system needed)
    $ sudo apt-get install libarchive12:i386  # libarchive 32bit for linking with srcML libs (12.04)
    # or libarchive13:i386 if that one is current version (14.04)

2.3 if using an old srcML version on an up-to-date system
  - (IMPORTANT) make soft links for updated libraries used by srcML, e.g.:
    $ sudo ln -s /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libarchive.so.12 /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libarchive.so.2

3. supply cppstats with the appropriate paths in cppstats_input.txt
    - use full paths like
        "/local/user/data/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2"
    - each project folder is structured as follows:
        > /cygdrive/c/Users/hunsen/data/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2/
            > source/ (here are the C source files)


CYGWIN
------

1. download and install git for windows (if needed)
    https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/releases/
    - git bash only
    - checkout as-is, commit as-is

1.1 checkout repo
    - NOTE: The old branch 'cygwin' is discontinued after version 0.8.
    $ git clone https://github.com/clhunsen/cppstats.git

2. download and install cygwin
    https://cygwin.com/install.html
    - install from internet
    - select any mirror
    - do not install any packages yet
    - wait setup for finish

2.1 open cygwin terminal
    - NOTE: your Windows drives are located at /cygdrive/!
    - run following command (in one line!):
        $ cygstart -- /path/to/setup-x86.exe
             -K http://cygwinports.org/ports.gpg
    - go through installation process as before BUT:
    - add and select following download site:
        http://ftp-stud.fht-esslingen.de/pub/Mirrors/sourceware.org/cygwinports/
    - install following packages (version number, newer versions should
      also work, except for Python 3.x):
        - All/Python/
            python (2.7.3-1)
            python-libxml2 (2.9.1-1)
            python-libxslt (1.1.27-2)
            python-lxml (3.2.3-1)
            python-pynotify (0.1.1-5)
        - All/Libs/
            libxml2 (2.9.1-1)
            libxml2-devel (2.9.1-1)
            libxslt (1.1.27-2)
            libxslt-devel (1.1.27-2)
        - All/Utils/
            astyle (2.03-1)
        - All/Devel/

        + all dependencies you are prompted for

2.2 download srcML libraries (current shipped version of srcML is supplied above!)
    - download a binary package that is sufficient for you from: http://www.srcml.org/lmcrs
        > http://www.srcml.org/lmcrs/srcML-Win.zip
    - extract into the subfolder lib/srcml/win/, so that binaries are available there directly
        > like "lib/srcml/win/src2srcml.exe"

3. supply cppstats with the appropriate paths in cppstats_input.txt
    - use cygwin-paths like
        "/cygdrive/c/Users/user/data/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2"
    - each project folder is structured as follows:
        > /cygdrive/c/Users/user/data/cpp-history/mpsolve/mpsolve-2.2/
            > source/ (here are the C source files)
