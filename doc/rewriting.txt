== EXAMPLE 1: nested #ifdefs and #elif branches

#ifdef A
	#ifdef B
	#endif
#endif

options:
1. conjoin the inner and outer #ifdef expressions.
	#ifdef A
		#ifdef A && B
		#endif
	#endif

2. leave it as it is.

current behavior: option 1.


== EXAMPLE 2: #else branches
(same for #elif branches)

#ifdef A
#else 
#endif

options:
1. rewrite #else branch as negation of the "normal" branch.

	#ifdef A
	#else !A
	#endif

2. leave it as it is.

current behavior: option 1.


== EXAMPLE 3: #elif branches

#ifdef A
#elif B
#endif

options:
1. conjoin expressions from #elif and (negated) #if.

	#ifdef A
	#elif (!A) && B
	#endif

2. leave it as it is.

current behavior: option 1.
